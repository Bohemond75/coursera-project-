Abstract : description of the dataset “tidy.txt” built from Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 
subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Subjects : 
ID of the subjects/persons tested, from 1 to 30.
Activities:
1 WALKING : the subject is walking 
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS : the subject is climbing stairs
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS : the subject is descending stairs
4 SITTING : the subject is seated
5 STANDING : the subject is standing
6 LAYING : the subject is laying 

Measures :

tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

Variables in the code :
accelero.Xtrain : dataset “X_train.txt”
accelero.Ytrain : dataset “Y_train.txt”
subject.train : dataset "subject_train.txt"
accelero.Xtest : dataset "X_test.txt"
accelero.Ytest : dataset "Y_test.txt"
subject.test : dataset "subject_test.txt" (contains all the ID of the subjects)
activity.labels : dataset "activity_labels.txt" (contains all the activities)
features : dataset “features.txt” (contains all the features)
accelero.Xtrain (the second one) : only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of Xtrain
accelero.Xtest (the second one) : only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement of Xest
data.train : merger of subject, acceleroYtrain nd accelero.Xtrain. 
data.test : merger of subject, acceleroYtest and accelero.Xtest.
final.dataset : merger of data.train and data.test
final.dataset (second one) : tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
